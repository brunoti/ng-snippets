# ng-snippets

Snippets for Sublime Text (by [@alsfurlan] (https://github.com/alsfurlan)) and Vim (by [@brunoti] (https://github.com/brunoti)) with all the main features of AngularJS based on [John Papa's Angular Style Guide] (https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).

## Using with Sublime Text

1. Clone this repo inside the user packages folder.  
    - `$ git clone https://github.com/alsfurlan/ng-snippets.git`
2. Go to `Preferences >  Browse Packages... > User` and paste the `sublime-text` folder content.

### Snippets
To use this snipets enter one of this shortcuts on a JavasScript file:


- `ngconfig`
- `ngconstant`  
- `ngcontroller`
- `ngdirective`  
- `ngfactory`
- `ngmodule`
- `ngservice`  


## Using with Vim

1. Install [neosnippet] (https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim) or [snipMate] (https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate) plugin on your vim.
2. Clone this repo:  
    - `git clone https://github.com/alsfurlan/ng-snippets.git`
3. For **snipMate** paste the `vim` folder content on the `~/.vim/snippets/` or `~/vimfiles/snippets/` for **Windows**.
4. For **neosnippet** paste the `vim` folder content on your **neosnippet** snippets folder.

> **NOTE:** I recommend neosnippet to use the snippets! It give less bugs and works with snipMate snippets to. [UltiSnips] (https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) is good to but is in Python and not VimL so it's hard to work on Windows.
